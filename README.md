# ProtoCentral HeartyBadge

HeartyBadge is simply our popular HeartyPatch single-lead ECG & Heart-rate variability (HRV) monitoring device made into a badge in time for DEFCON 26, where I presented about our HealthyPi open-source patient monitor. We think of HeartyBadge as a ECG and HRV development board, on a badge. 


The following are the main features of the HeartyBadge: 
* Single-lead ECG monitoring with the MAX30003 
* 2 gold-plated pads on the PCB act as electrodes 
* ESP32 with PCB antenna supporting Bluetooth & Wi-Fi 
* 144 APA102 RGB addressable LEDs (most of them in a matrix) 
* On-board Li-Ion battery with charging 
* USB for charging, code upload as well as debugging
